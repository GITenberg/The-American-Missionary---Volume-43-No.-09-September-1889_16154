<p><a name="The_next_annual_meeting" id="The_next_annual_meeting"></a>The next annual meeting of the American Missionary Association will be
held at Chicago, Ill., in the New England Church, commencing at three
o'clock Tuesday afternoon, October 29. Rev. R.R. Meredith, D.D., of
Brooklyn, N.Y., will preach the sermon. On the last page of the cover
will be found directions as to membership and other items of interest.
Fuller details regarding the reception of delegates and their
entertainment, together with rates at hotels, and railroad and steamboat
reductions, will be given in the religious press and in the next number
of the MISSIONARY.</p>

<p>A meeting of exceptional interest is expected, and we trust our friends
will be present in large force.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="THE_TREASURY" id="THE_TREASURY"></a>THE TREASURY.</h2>

<p>It will encourage the contributors to the great work entrusted to us, to
know that the friends of the A.M.A. are enabling us to make a very
hopeful report up to this date.</p>

<p>If those who have not shared in the work of the Association as yet, this
year, will make a corresponding effort with those who have done so, we
shall have reason to hope that we can go to our Annual Meeting in
Chicago, owing no man anything but love and good will.</p>

<p>But those who have waited are many, and we are waiting and depending on
these. Those who have not taken their contributions have the power to
convert our hopes into realities.</p>

<p>We appeal, therefore, to the pastors whose collections for this fiscal
year have not been taken to take their collections and forward them to
our treasury before the close of September.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><span class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>[242]</span>
<h2><a name="AS_TO_METHODS" id="AS_TO_METHODS"></a>AS TO "METHODS".</h2>

<p>We have been thinking that the methods of Christ were divine as well as
his truth, and that when the Christian world will use Christ's methods
in the propagation of truth there will be a great advance upon some
features of the present. Dr. Parkhurst has some very suggestive
sentences in this line of thought in a sermon on "The Regenerative Force
of the Gospel." His words are: "Christ never patches. The Gospel is not
here to mend people. Regeneration is not a scheme of moral tinkering and
ethical cobbling. In the Gospel, we move into a new world and under a
new scheme. The Gospel does not classify with other schemes of
amelioration."</p>

<p>This accords with our thought of the methods of Christ. The way to meet
that which is wrong, is to meet it as a wrong. We shall not do well to
ameliorate it. If we may not expect those who have been "raised" amid
prejudices and ignorance to be leaders for the absolute rectitude of
things, those who have not lived where this excuse is available should
be the leaders. If some do not lead, none will follow. Where principles
were at stake, Christ never gave way to prejudices. He never yielded to
that which was in itself wrong. If those to whom he ministered could not
come up to his standard, then he waited, but he never compromised. That
which is right should not yield to that which is wrong.</p>

<p>It may take a right hand. It may take an eye. But "If thy right hand
offend thee, cut it off," and "If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it
out." He would not "cut it off" by amputating the finger and gradually
disjointing it up to the mark; and plucking out the offending eye is not
to bandage it so that it temporarily does not see the evil to which it
is attracted. No, the Gospel is not a system of repairs. It is not here
to temporize, but to make all things new, and it strikes at the heart of
evil and not at its surface.</p>

<p>It was not Christ's method to ignore an evil which confronted him. He
did not evade or get around issues. He met them. He answered them. He
was an "incarnate conscience" in the land. He knew what was in man. His
followers cannot fail when they walk closely with him in the path which
he has made plain.</p>

<h2><a name="FIVE_QUESTIONS" id="FIVE_QUESTIONS"></a>FIVE QUESTIONS.</h2>

<p>1.&mdash;If the Georgia Association had been without any colored members in
it, would the Georgia Conference ever have been formed?</p>

<p>2.&mdash;If the Georgia Association had been without any colored members,
would the Georgia Conference have declined to unite with it, on some one
of the terms submitted by the Georgia Association?</p>

<p>3.&mdash;If the Georgia Association had been without any colored members,
would this curious and ingenious scheme of "co-ordinate and equal
bodies," "to elect delegates" to visit each other now and then ever have
been concocted?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>[243]</span>4.&mdash;Is it worth while to "darken counsel with words" as to methods, when
it is evident that the purpose is, not to form any union which would be
other than humiliating to a colored man, and contrary to the heretofore
held principles of the Congregational Churches?</p>

<p>5.&mdash;Why these arguments to show "how not to do it," when to do it would
be so simple and so evidently Christian?</p>

<p>Q. <i>When are Home Missions properly so called?</i></p>

<p>A. When they are ordained to save the unevangelized people of the land
in which they dwell.</p>

<p>Q. <i>When are missions properly called Foreign Missions?</i></p>

<p>A. When they are missions to foreigners in a foreign country.</p>

<p>Q. <i>Are missions among the Indians in this country, Foreign Missions?</i></p>

<p>A. They are not, though the Indians have been treated as foreigners,
which has been the source of great wrongs and many sorrows.</p>

<p>Q. <i>Are missions to the Chinese in this country, Foreign Missions?</i></p>

<p>A. They are not, though the Chinese are refused the privileges accorded
other foreigners. The missions of the A.M.A. on the Pacific Coast are
most fruitful and hopeful, and, since these foreigners return to China,
there is an interblending of Home and Foreign Missions here, that is
full of promise.</p>

<p>Q. <i>Are the missions of the A.M.A. in the South, Foreign Missions?</i></p>

<p>A. They are not, though they have been successful in exciting interest
for Africa among the students of their schools. Some of these are now
foreign missionaries; others are preparing to go; but the missions of
the A.M.A. in the broadest sense are Home Missions, for they minister to
white and black as to citizens of a common country, who alike need the
Gospel. The A.M.A. is planting white churches (so called) every year,
and has added several this year, though none of them would refuse
membership to a man because he is black, and is planting colored
churches (so called), none of which should be excluded from State
Associations merely because of color.</p>

<p>Q. <i>Should the missions of the A.M.A. be called Foreign Missions because
its schools and churches cannot win the co-operation of the Christians
among whom they live?</i></p>

<p>A. They did not at once win the co-operation of Christians among whom
they went, but confidence has been growing with the years until the
cases are exceptional where they do not have the co-operation of
enlightened and broad-minded Christians. In most cases, the schools and
churches of the A.M.A. have won both confidence and gratitude throughout
the South. Southern men are among the trustees of its institutions, and
everywhere its Field Superintendents and Secretaries are greeted with
cordiality. A prominent editor of a Southern political paper&mdash;white and
<span class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>[244]</span>democratic&mdash;testifies this month: "<i>Yours is the most practical
missionary work ever undertaken by a Christian body, and should have the
hearty and unstinted support of all Christians.</i>" The cases are few
where good will does not exist between its teachers and ministers and
the white people among whom they live.</p>

<p>Q. <i>Does not social ostracism show that the white teacher is engaged in
a Foreign Mission?</i></p>

<p>A. Social ostracism is gradually giving way among the more intelligent
Christian people. Nothing, however, dies so hard as prejudice, and
nothing is so cruel; but missions do not cease to be Home Missions,
because they may be where there is sinful prejudice and dense ignorance.</p>

<p>Q. <i>What would be Foreign Missions in the South?</i></p>

<p>A. Missions in the South which would treat an entire race as foreigners
and aliens because in God's wisdom he has seen fit to make them black,
would be foreign to the spirit of the Gospel: "For He is our peace who
hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition
between us. Through Him, we both have access by one Spirit unto the
Father. Now, therefore, ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
fellow citizens with the saints and of the general household of God, and
built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ
himself being the chief corner stone; in whom all the building, fitly
framed together, groweth into a holy temple in the Lord." Missions in
the South which exclude pastors and delegates from Associations and
Conferences, would be foreign to the Gospel. Missions in the South
founded upon an aristocracy of skin, would be foreign to the spirit of
the Gospel. Missions which would preach against caste in India, and
perpetuate it in America, would be foreign to the methods of Christ, and
to Christian methods in foreign lands.</p>

<p>Q. <i>Does the A.M.A. believe in mixed churches of white and black
people?</i></p>

<p>A. The A.M.A. does not regard it as at all probable that such churches
will exist to any great extent. Race tastes and race affiliations will
make for churches essentially white and essentially black. "But to close
the door on any Christian is in so far to make it an unchristian church.
To go into the South and establish white churches from which, whether by
a formal law or by an unwritten but self-forcing edict, men are excluded
because God made them black, is to deny one of the fundamental tenets of
Christ. There is no need to attempt to corral all men of all races in
one enclosure, but for any church, especially a church of the Puritans,
to enter upon a missionary work in the South and initiate it by refusing
to fellowship a black man because he is black, is to apostatize from the
faith in order to get a chance to preach the faith." The doors of every
Christian church ought to stand wide open to men of every race and
color, and in all representative bodies these churches should be one.</p>

work?</i></p>

<p>A. It is: The Roman Catholic Church would not for a moment recognize any
color-line in its assemblies or priesthood.</p>

<p>Q. <i>Does the A.M.A. believe in the social equality of the races?</i></p>

<p>A. The A.M.A. has never seen any social equality anywhere, and believes
and teaches nothing about it. It believes in the Fatherhood of God and
the brotherhood of man.</p>

<p>Q. <i>Is the A.M.A. agitating the color-line question?</i></p>

<p>A. It is not. It always has proclaimed its principles for the interests
of the oppressed, and always has championed the cause of God's poor,
pleading for the right because it is right.</p>

<p>Q. <i>Why is the A.M.A. in the South doing its work in schools and
churches among white and black?</i></p>

<p>A. Because the Lord has said; "Behold, I have set before thee an open
door, and no man can shut it."</p>

<p>Our esteemed brother, Rev. G.C. Rowe, pastor of the Plymouth
Congregational Church, Charleston, S.C., and his associates, on their
return from the meeting of the Joint Committee on the union of the
Georgia Association and the Georgia Conference, were forcibly
transferred to an inferior car on the Georgia Railroad. They were not
driven from the train, they were allowed to ride, and the car in which
they rode was connected with the cars containing the white passengers.
They were simply separated from the others and that only because they
were colored persons.</p>

<p>The reception these honored ministers of Christ met in the Joint
Committee was very much of the same sort. The white brethren did not
deny them their place in the church&mdash;nay, the two bodies, white and
colored, were to be connected together, but these colored brethren were
to be kept separate and that only because they were colored persons.</p>

<p>An appeal will be made to the courts, but the interesting question is:
which will be first to recognize the equal manhood of the colored man&mdash;
the cars, the courts or the church? Would it not be a shame to the
church and a dishonor to the Christian name if the church should be the
last?</p>

<h2><a name="THE_WORK_OF_THE_AMERICAN_MISSIONARY_ASSOCIATION_AND_FOREIGN_MISSIONS" id="THE_WORK_OF_THE_AMERICAN_MISSIONARY_ASSOCIATION_AND_FOREIGN_MISSIONS"></a>THE WORK OF THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION AND FOREIGN MISSIONS.</h2>

<h4>BY REV. FRANK B. JENKINS.</h4>

<p>The American Missionary Association has done both home and foreign
missionary work. There is nothing in its constitution or traditions to
prevent its doing the same again.</p>

<p>Providence, however, seems to indicate clearly that its work at present
be within the United States. While in this sense it does home missionary
work, the peculiar conditions of the people among whom it mostly labors
require largely the methods of foreign missions. It must supply the
school, as well as the church; industrial training as well as that which
is intellectual and moral. It must create a native ministry and develop
native workers of all kinds. In fact, it would be hard to find on
foreign mission fields a single kind of activity which is not duplicated
in the fields of the American Missionary Association.</p>

<p>Home missions aid foreign missions by creating the conditions of more
income and more missionaries for foreign fields. The work of this
Association has done this already to some extent; without doubt it is to
do it to a far greater extent in the future.</p>

<p>In taking people from the ignorance and poverty of slavery and savagery,
it could not be expected to form them at once into large givers or
efficient workers for foreign fields; but who can say, after the marvels
of the past twenty-four years, what the future shall show, when the
coming millions shall arise and, out of gratitude for what they have
received, give of their increasing means and send forth their sons and
daughters to tell the glad story of freedom, truth and love.</p>

<p>It has been a favorite idea of many that the Negroes of America should
evangelize Africa. Perhaps some have been disappointed that so few of
them have gone to Africa as missionaries; but such, I am sure, have
failed fully to consider the facts. A people who had received only the
degrading tuition of slavery could not produce at once many who should
have the reliable qualities and the intellectual and moral training
needed for the responsible and, to a large extent, the unsuperintended
work of a foreign missionary. Then, every capable preacher, teacher and
leader has been needed in a hundred places at home. They could scarcely
be justified in leaving their own brothers and sisters in heathenism and
without the truth within their reach, to go to the heathen abroad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>[247]</span>Yet a few have gone forth and proved themselves capable, faithful and
successful. A former slave of Jefferson Davis is not only a successful
missionary in Africa, but has proved himself such a level-headed man
that he has been chosen treasurer of one of the missions of the American
Board. Such as he are an earnest of what shall be, when the colored
people shall be more fully evangelized and the appeal for Africa can be
made strong to their hearts and consciences. Then there will be such a
going forth as will astonish the Christian Church.</p>

<p>The bearing of the work for the one hundred thousand Chinese in this
country on foreign missions can be clearly seen. Christian work for them
is missionary work for China&mdash;it sends them back to become missionaries
to their native land. The fruitfulness of this work for foreign missions
has been fully demonstrated.</p>

<p>The possibilities of the influence of the evangelization of the Indians
on foreign missions is a topic which I do not remember having seen or
heard mentioned. Yet it seems to me worth thinking about.</p>

<p>Mexico has four million Indians; Central America, one million five
hundred thousand, and South America seven million. Here is a foreign
mission field of twelve and a half million souls. How can it be
otherwise than that, when once the Indians of our land shall come to
have and appreciate the blessings of a Christian civilization, their
hearts shall be stirred by the needs of their brethren according to the
flesh, and that they will go to them with the gospel story?</p>

<p>There remains one other field&mdash;the whites of the South and especially
the "Mountain Whites." As a class, they are poor, ignorant and needy in
every way&mdash;materially, intellectually, morally and spiritually, but
<i>they are not the "poor, white trash" of the South</i>. As good blood flows
in their veins as in the veins of the Northern people. A wrong start and
their surroundings have made them what they are. Give them schools and
pure and enlightened churches and they will awake into new life as fast
as any people ever did. They will show in years what missionary work can
usually show only in decades. In Williamsburg Academy, Ky., nearly every
boy in the higher classes is expecting to prepare for the ministry, and
that school is only a little over half a dozen years old and is the
first one opened in our mountain work.</p>

<p>Give these mountain boys and girls a chance, and the people who gave the
nation a Lincoln will give it ministers and missionaries, not only for
the seven mountain States, but also for other home mission fields and
for foreign lands.</p>

<p>If the Congregational churches will listen to the call of Christ and
appreciate the opportunity which he has placed before them, there may be
in these mountains, filled with their marvellous mineral wealth,
Congregational churches which shall be not only self-supporting, but
give generously for the advancement of Christ's kingdom throughout the
earth. The most <span class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>[248]</span>generous giver I know, is a native of the mountains and
a member of one of our missionary churches.</p>

<h2><a name="ROME_AND_THE_NEGRO" id="ROME_AND_THE_NEGRO"></a>ROME AND THE NEGRO.</h2>

<p>One of our most interesting exchanges is an "<i>Illustrated Roman Catholic
Quarterly</i> edited and published by the Fathers of St. Joseph's
Missionary Society of the Sacred Heart," its "Record of Missions among
the Colored People of the United States."</p>

<p>We need not say that we have no sympathy with Romanism and its errors,
nor with the "Missionary Society of the Sacred Heart," and its efforts
to plant Romanism among the colored people of the South.</p>

<p>We can, however, but admire the fidelity of the church to its doctrines,
and the Christian example it gives to all missionary societies in its
recognition of man as man. The quotations which we make from the Roman
Catholic Quarterly will account for the strong hold that Romanism is
beginning to secure upon the negro race.</p>

<p>The following, for example, is a Roman Catholic tribute to John Brown:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On the 2nd of December next, thirty years will have passed
since John Brown, in his sixtieth winter, ascended the scaffold
and gave his life for the colored race.</p>

<p>Connecticut gave the hero birth&mdash;from heroes; New York, in her
Adirondack recesses, developed in him that spirit of liberty
which Ohio had nurtured, and is forever honored by his grave;
while Virginia, "building better than she knew," bestowed the
martyr's crown. It was necessary that one man should die for the
people (John xviii, 14), and God arranged that he who is likewise
one of the great benefactors of the human race as well as of his
native land should crimson and beautify with his blood the soil
that gave a cradle and a tomb to the Father of his Country.</p>

<p>Grand indeed is the greatness of the rock-ribbed Adirondacks
where John Brown lived, prayed, thought out his great
life-thought, and made his first trials in the work of emancipation,
but grander is the stone there that marks the grave of him whose
mighty spirit is still "marching on;" for the greatness of that
soul invests the tomb with moral grandeur, and calls "all the
astonishing magnificence of unintelligent creation poor."</p>

<p>Fair indeed are the banks of the Shenandoah, and beautiful the
landscape on which the dying eyes of the hero rested, but more
lovely far the death of him and of his sons and comrades,&mdash;"even
in death they were not divided" (2nd Kings i, 19), because the
most beautiful thing in the world or out of it is love, and he
and they died of love for their brethren, God's children. It is
truly fitting, therefore, that they who were rescued by him from
bondage should love and honor his glorious name, and that we all
should chant the praises of the man who was the chosen instrument
of Providence in destroying out of our country the inhuman custom
of human slavery.</p></div>

<p>The <i>Southern Congregationalist</i>, published in Atlanta, does not have a
high opinion of such men as John Brown. We quote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There are men who never are mistaken. If your opinion or plan, no
matter how well sustained, differs from theirs, they solemnly
greet you: "Our conscience is our monitor: we can make no
concessions of principle." The case is ended. You may as well
make your humble bow and pass on, leaving them in their lofty and
superior <span class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>[249]</span>place. Such men are of little use in the world. They may
have a few satellites, but that is all. It is noticeable how
uniformly the conscience and principles of these men agree with
their prejudices, salaries and other interests, and with changed
circumstances how "concessions" distill from them gently as the
dew.</p></div>

<p>We quote again from the <i>St. Joseph's Advocate</i>, as to the color line:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Man was created in God's own image and likeness. This image and
likeness is, however, not a physical one, it is a spiritual or
soul likeness. The likeness and image of the operation of the
human soul&mdash;the mind&mdash;through the material, physical medium of
the brain, is not only similar, but substantially and formally
alike in every division of the human race. It thus follows that
fundamentally there is an identity of mental or soul activity and
action in all the human race. Neither color, nor form, nor
feature, nor clime, operates a change on the formal and
fundamental identity of human thought as evolved by the human
mind....</p>

<p>It follows that the negro race, thinking the same thoughts, have
the same apprehension of the perfect, good and true, and,
thinking in the same lines as the Caucassian race, must needs be
of the same order of creation, in the image and likeness of their
Maker, although physically different in color, yet in mind and
soul the same. This, too, removes the theory of the inferiority
of races, and relegates it to the lumber room of the mere
physicist or corporal anatomist, who, because he cannot find life
in death any more than thought, would deny life as he would deny
the soul, even as La Place would not admit a Creator&mdash;God&mdash;
because he could not see him at the end of his telescope....</p>

<p>Naturally working for and under white men, their industry,
versatility and submissiveness have made many people think they
were an inferior race. This cannot be. Give them a fair chance in
life's battle, train their minds, fill their immortal souls with
worthy conceptions of the truth as only presented by the Roman
Catholic Church, and you will make of the negro race a kind,
charitable, intelligent, worthy Christian people, as full of love
for the country of their former enslavement as the best patriot
descendant of the Revolutionary fathers. Tried in peace and in
war when they have received but half the training of the white
race, they have not been found wanting, but have proven
themselves worthy of offices of trust and honor in every sphere
of life and as good Christians as God has ever granted His divine
grace to. His promises are for all nations and for all times, and
necessarily for the negro as for the white man, all of whom in
their souls are created in His own image and likeness from the
beginning.</p></div>

<p>Apropos of Romanism among the colored people, Archbishop Janssens,
of New Orleans, writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Last year there were baptized 3,705 colored children and 297
colored adults, which I estimate forms a population of about
75,000 Catholics in this Diocese.</p>

<p>We have six convents of colored Sisters, of which four are
schools, one an asylum for 74 girls, and the other an asylum, for
21 old women. There are, besides, nine schools conducted by white
Sisters, and eleven schools conducted by lay teachers&mdash;in all,
twenty-four schools with 1,330 scholars. It is not bad.</p></div>

<p>At Emmetsburg, Maryland, the Roman Catholics report the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Sisters are putting up a large and fine edifice</i> which will
be ready for business in September, and will accommodate all the
Catholic children, both white-colored and black-colored in the
town and vicinity. I am curious to know if this is the first
instance in which children of both the dominant races will be
educated under one roof.</p></div>

<p>Says the editor: "How quickly the color-line disappears in the Catholic
Church."</p>

<h2><a name="NOTES_BY_THE_WAY" id="NOTES_BY_THE_WAY"></a>NOTES BY THE WAY.</h2>

<h4>BY DISTRICT SECRETARY C.J. RYDER.</h4>

<p>Not long ago, I met a Frenchman in the halls of the Congregational
House, who was looking for Secretary Coit of the Massachusetts Home
Missionary Society. He evidently had a very limited knowledge of the
English language, for he accosted me as follows:&mdash;"You&mdash;eh, you
somewheres? Ah! I begs my pardon."</p>

<p>This amusing bungle of the French brother fairly represents my condition
during the past few weeks. I have not been altogether sure that I was
even "somewheres." Preaching one Sunday in Dover, N.H., the next in
Talladega, Ala., the next at Santee Agency, Neb., the next on the
Cheyenne River, Dak., then enjoying a communion season with Brother Hall
at Fort Berthold, and the next standing beside the pastor of a New
England Church at the same Lord's table.</p>

<p>The days between these Sabbaths were filled with pleasant duties, in
talking over the great work of our Association with the earnest and
devoted missionaries. But many things are impressed upon one's thought
by such a trip as this. We realize more than ever that the American
Missionary Association is a great National Society, limited neither
geographically nor by any race restrictions; actually gathering in its
schools and missions, Negroes, Whites and Indians, and Chinese and
Japanese, and Hondurans and Cubans, and who knows how many other needy
and destitute people! Another fact that must impress one, is the
thoroughness of the work done. The examinations were thorough and
exhaustive in the schools. This was true, not only in the lower grades,
but also in the advanced classes. Dr. Andrews conducted the examinations
in Church History, at Talladega, which would have done credit to any of
our Theological Seminaries. And Dr. DeForest's classes in Mental
Philosophy gave evidence of careful study and of assimilation of that
which they had studied. They had not only eaten, but had digested their
mental food. The same was true at Fisk. What a grand thing it would be,
if the good friends of the Association in New England, and elsewhere in
the North, to whom our work is only presented through an appeal for
funds, might visit some of these grand institutions in the South and
West, and see just what is being done for these neglected people! The
work cannot be appreciated in its vast importance and magnificent
results, except after such a personal inspection of the field.</p>


<p>These large institutions are the centers of still larger missionary work
outside. One professor in Talladega, a graduate of Harvard, has been
especially busy during the last year, developing the Sunday-school work
in the surrounding districts. The following are some of the results:&mdash;
eight Sunday-schools enrolling about five hundred scholars; thirty
teachers, all students in the College; two schools meet in buildings
belonging to the <span class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>[251]</span>College, three in log churches, owned by other
denominations, not having Sunday-schools, two in log cabins. "In one
school, teachers and scholars have to huddle together under umbrellas,
if they have any, or go wet, if they haven't them, whenever it rains;
and it is a sight which makes one long for better accommodations, that
more efficient work may be done," writes this self-sacrificing professor
in a note just received. In one house, he found a family of white
children, all of them very ignorant, and, so far as he was able to
discover, there was not a single book of any kind in the cabin. He
invited the children to Sunday-school, where, like Robert Raikes, he
teaches reading and spelling as well as the Bible, but the mother
indignantly refused, saying that she "didn't let her children go to
school with Niggers!"</p>

<p>There are many evidences of heroic sacrifice on the part of the people
among whom we labor, that one runs across in such a trip as this. Here
is one: A small church in Alabama has recently voted to pay fifty
dollars per month of their pastor's salary, that they may become
self-supporting, and so let the funds which they have received go to
other more needy fields. There are seventy-five persons in this church
who might be termed paying members; of all these, the pastor informed
me, not more than fifteen receive over a dollar per day; sixty receive
less than this. They pay, on an average, ten dollars per month for rent;
there are twenty-six working-days to the month, and they often lose at
least five of these, on account of weather or lack of work, making an
income of only twenty-one dollars per month. Ten dollars going for rent,
leaves but eleven dollars for the support of the family. Pretty heroic
economy that!</p>

<p>The Annual Meeting of the Dakota Mission, the Convention of missionaries
who are at work in the Indian field under the direction of this
Association, gathered at Santee Agency, Nebraska, Saturday, June 15, and
was full of interest. Sessions were held for three days, and continued
late into the night. Thrilling incidents of exposure on the prairie
during winter, swimming swollen and chilly streams, breaking through the
ice when crossing, which, in one case, resulted in the drowning of a
team of horses, seemed to be every-day incidents in the life of these
heroic missionaries, who are carrying on this noble work among the
Indians. The two Riggs brothers, whose heredity as well as personal
consecration fit them for large usefulness in the Indian work, were
especially rich in experience and inspiring in conference. One thing,
especially, impressed me in this Indian work, and that was, the
difference in character between the average teacher employed by the
Government and those employed by this Association and other missionary
bodies. Many noble men and women are at work under the Government in
teaching the Indians, but the purpose of the Government-school at the
best is simply to make intelligent citizens. The purpose of the
mission-school is to develop character, to inculcate purity, to create
moral earnestness, <span class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>[252]</span>in other words, not simply to citizenize, but to
Christianize. We need more mission schools among the Indians, for only
the mission idea can redeem a pagan people. I would like to speak of
Miss Collins's work, gradually bringing the village of Running Antelope
on the Grand River into the knowledge of Christ, and of the developing
work at Fort Yates, and of the work among the Mandans, Rees and Gros
Ventres, and of the motley and picturesque crowd that gathered for
communion in the little church at Fort Berthold; but the interesting
facts from these fields must be left for other notes.</p>

exceptionally small this year, having been less in number than usual on

<h2><a name="TILLOTSON_INSTITUTE_AUSTIN_TEXAS" id="TILLOTSON_INSTITUTE_AUSTIN_TEXAS"></a>TILLOTSON INSTITUTE, AUSTIN, TEXAS.</h2>

<p>Wednesday, June 5, witnessed the close of the eighth year in the history
of Tillotson Institute. The closing exercises began on Thursday, May 30,
with the annual written examinations which, on account of the very large
attendance of this year&mdash;greater than ever before&mdash;meant more work than
usual for the teachers. These examinations cover the work of the entire
year, and are looked forward to with much apprehension by the students.</p>

<p>For the past three years, the last Saturday afternoon before
commencement has been set apart as "Tillotson Day," and devoted to
exercises appropriate to such an occasion. This year, Rev. W.H. Shaw,
pastor of the <span class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>[253]</span>Cumberland Presbyterian Church in this city, addressed the
students in the chapel. This was followed by a pic-nic on the school
grounds.</p>

<p>The last Sunday in the school is rather a sad day to most of the
teachers. There are many interests in these Sunday-schools which one
cannot bear the thought of leaving for four long months. We can only
hope that the good seed sown during the year has not fallen on stony
ground or by the wayside, and that it will survive the heat of the
summer.</p>

<p>Monday and Tuesday were devoted to oral examinations. These were held in
the chapel and were attended by an unusually large number of the parents
and friends of the students from the city and elsewhere. The classes
acquitted themselves very creditably; especially good, however, were the
examinations of the seventh grade in geometry and the fourth grade in
geography.</p>

<p>More attention has been given this year to industrial training than ever
before. In the recitation rooms, were specimens of the handiwork of the
students in the various industrial departments. A class of little girls
told of the various forms of needlework, which was something more than
theory with them, as their samples of work on exhibition testified.
There was not a useless article in the entire collection; they have been
taught how to make serviceable garments. Very neat specimens of darning
and mending were displayed, also.</p>

<p>The cooking classes exhibited samples of their skill. The disappearance
of all the handiwork of this class in the course of inspection witnessed
to its success. The classes in carpentry displayed specimens of their
skill. This is the first year that this industry has been taught here.</p>

<p>On Tuesday evening, occurred the annual musical and rhetorical
entertainment. A large audience is always expected on this occasion, but
this year it was larger than ever. Before eight o'clock, the chapel with
the adjoining halls and recitation rooms were filled, and
notwithstanding the efforts of the ushers to find room for every one,
about half the number were obliged to go away. One little boy who came
especially to see the dumbbell drill was found under the front steps,
after the close of the entertainment, fast asleep. He had taken refuge
there to await a chance to get a seat in the chapel later in the
evening.</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning, an audience of much more manageable magnitude than
that of the previous evening assembled at 10 o'clock, to listen to the
regular commencement exercises. These consisted of essays, orations,
recitations and declamations. Two young men, one of whom was graduated
last year from the elementary normal course, were graduated from the
higher normal course. The original productions presented this year were
said to have been unusually good. A visitor, in an address made after
the presentation of the diplomas, in speaking of the excellence of the
orations said of one of them, "It would be creditable on the platform of
any school in the United States."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>[254]</span>The year just ended has been one of hard work and great prosperity. The
attendance has been not only larger than ever before, but constant, and
the result of such steady and persistent work is, as might be expected,
gratifying progress in all departments.</p>

<p>An account of the closing exercises of Avery Institute in South
Carolina, was given in the MISSIONARY last month. A copy of the
valedictory address of one of the pupils has been sent to us, from which
we excerpt one or two passages to give the flavor of the occasion. We
think it would be creditable to any school of like grade in the country.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To-day we are to go forth. Is it strange that emotions deep and
solemn should pervade our hearts? Amid these emotions, gratitude
stands prominent&mdash;gratitude to the honored Association which has
placed within our reach these opportunities for the development
of intellect and of character that fit us to take our places in
life as intelligent men and women. In behalf of the class of '89
and of all our schoolmates, we return to THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY
ASSOCIATION our heartfelt thanks, and invoke for it the richest
blessings of Him who maketh rich.... In bidding adieu to
school life, the thought which presses most forcibly is that we
are supposed now to be ready for our duties in life. Let us
rather remember that we have but caught a glimpse of the
knowledge which lies beyond and which beckons to us. May our
thirst for it be insatiable. Let us take care of each day and
each hour, and show to our Heavenly Father that we love his
precepts, and are seeking to live true and holy lives. Our places
here will soon be filled, but nothing will take away from our
hearts the memories of dear old <i>Avery</i>.</p></div>

<h2><a name="MISSIONARY_VISITS" id="MISSIONARY_VISITS"></a>MISSIONARY VISITS.</h2>

<h4>BY MRS. A.W. CURTIS.</h4>

<p>We were going out for a ride, a pleasure ride, a mission of mercy to the
sick and afflicted, to carry them spiritual and physical comforts.</p>

<p>We have no missionary horse and buggy, and it was not an elegant
equipage standing before our door. Our steed was a very lank, bony,
long-eared mule, and the vehicle a rather disreputable looking old
delivery wagon, kindly loaned to us by our grocer; but we were thankful
for anything that would take us safely. We soon came to a deep,
ugly-looking ravine, that must be crossed. I walked over the log that
spanned it, while Dominie "rattled his bones over the stones," down the
steep descent, and up the farther side in safety, thanks to the
sure-footed mule. Just beyond was a small rude cabin. The old chimney had
tumbled down, leaving nearly the whole of one side entirely open to the
weather. Inside, upon a bed that nearly filled the small room, lay a woman
who was paralyzed. A little child was her only attendant. Some kind
neighbor, however, had made her clean and comfortable for the day. The
poor woman could not move, but her dark eyes beamed with delight at the
sight of us, and the poor drawn face expressed the joy she could not
speak. We talked of the dear friend <span class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>[255]</span>Jesus, whom she loved and trusted,
sang together a song of faith, and commended her to heaven's mercy and
kindness, in prayer.</p>

<p>On we went again, over the hills, the sun climbing higher and growing
hotter every moment. Then we turned off into some dim cool woods,
picking our way through rough ravines and blind tracks until we reached
another little cabin home. We had to bend low to enter the door of the
rough, rude house, yet the one low room, with loft above, sheltered a
family of nine persons.</p>

<p>Upon a bed, the dear old grandmother was dying, but the dark cabin
seemed illuminated by the shining face of the happy saint.</p>

<p>"You are almost home, Auntie?"</p>

<p>"Yes chile, almost home!"</p>

<p>"And you find Jesus dear and precious, now?"</p>

<p>"Yes! yes! dear and precious."</p>

<p>I held her cold, almost pulseless hands in mine, while her minister read
comforting words of hope from the blessed Word. Then we sang for her,
closing with&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"Oh come, angel bands, come and around me stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Oh bear me away on your snowy wings<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To my eternal home."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Her dark face was fairly radiant. She lifted her hands toward heaven,
and though our eyes were holden that we could not see, we <i>felt</i> that
the Lord and his angels were glorifying that humble abode, making it the
gateway of heaven. Holding fast to our hands as we knelt beside her bed,
she murmured responses to our prayers.</p>

<p>With uplifted hearts, we said our last good-bye, and went away rejoicing
in her triumph over the terrors of death and at the thought of the glory
that awaited her. As we passed out of sight, she entered within the
gates, with that radiant look upon her face; and the next day at sunset
we laid her away to rest.</p>


<p>From this "Beulah-land," we hastened on to visit a man who was in the
last stages of consumption. We had been for some time doing what we
could that he might be prepared for the great change that was drawing
near. In the low doorway, sat an old hag-like woman, who stared at us
with a look of rage, as we passed by her into the room where the sick
man was. Sultry as was the day, there was a hot blaze in the cavernous
fireplace. Over it hung an iron kettle, from which most sickening odors
emanated. The sick man was in a heavy stupor. We tried in vain to arouse
him, even for a moment. His wife looked unusually cheerful, as she
assured us that he "was a great deal better; that he did not cough at
all, and rested mighty easy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>[256]</span>We understood the situation at once. The poor woman was densely
ignorant, and believed her husband had been "conjured." The old hag in
the doorway was "a witch doctor," who had promised to cure him for ten
dollars! How the poor wife with her five little children to support
managed to raise it, God only knows; but she had done it, and was
pouring down that unconscious man's throat, hourly doses of a villainous
compound of most loathsome things, over which the old hag muttered her
incantations, and worked her Satanic spells. She watched us with her
evil eye as we looked pityingly upon the poor sufferer, and glared
menacingly when we told the poor wife that he was no better; that the
end was near.</p>

<p>That very night the death-like stupor was broken by agonies of torture
which racked the wasted frame for many hours. There was no respite for a
prayer, or for a thought of the eternity into which his poor soul was
hastening. The witch doctor fled in haste, unable to endure the sight of
the tortures she herself had invoked. It was an unutterable relief when
those shrieks of agony were hushed by the awful silence of death.</p>

<p>To us, there came an added burden of care as we realized how many of
this people are still in bondage to these heathenish customs and
superstitions. Nothing but the light of a pure gospel and the elevating
influences of education, will lift them out of their degradation. It
will take years of time, and patient labor, and will cost something; but
these souls are precious to God. They are "the heathen at our door."
There are <i>millions</i> of them! They will soon be a mighty power for good
or evil in our nation. Which shall it be?</p>

<h2><a name="A_CALL_FROM_AUNT_MARY" id="A_CALL_FROM_AUNT_MARY"></a>A CALL FROM AUNT MARY.</h2>

<p>Aunt Mary is a member of one of our colored churches&mdash;a genuine daughter
of Africa&mdash;possessing characteristics belonging rather to the rougher
than the softer sex&mdash;a peddler by occupation; peddling cast-off clothing
(which she gets from white folks) among her colored sisters.</p>

<p>This business, together with her masculine performances and her
qualification in plantation melodies, makes her exceedingly popular with
the colored people of the town.</p>

<p>"Hello! Hello!" rang out from the highest key-note one morning just
after breakfast. Going to the door to see who it was, aunt Mary was
standing at the gate; she had come to make us a social and business
call.</p>

<p>"Dog bite?" she asked. "Yes," was the reply, "but he won't bite you,
open the gate." Aunt Mary opened it and entered the yard. "Mornin'"
(again at a high key). "Good morning, walk in." "I come roun ter see you
all dis mornin'; I dun know if I am 'ceptable." "Certainly, aunt Mary,
you are, walk in and take a seat by the fire."</p>

<p>Aunt Mary walked in, took a seat before the fire, placed her bag and an
old hat-box on the floor by her side and for a moment looked around the
<span class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>[257]</span>room, noticing everything. Then she took up the poker, commenced poking
the fire, as if she wanted more heat to enable her to explain the chief
object of her visit. The heat is now up to the degree required, the
poker is laid aside, the old hat-box is in her lap, and aunt Mary is
ready to talk business. Opening the box, she said to Mrs. R., "Sister, I
have something har I want ter show you; dun know if you want ter see
it." "What is it?" Mrs. R. enquired. Here she pulled out a second-hand
bonnet trimmed in high colors. "A lady," she said, "give me dis last
night to sell. I aint show it to no body yet; she say to take it to some
of de preachers' wives be case it's too stylish for these yer common
niggers." The hat was examined and returned with, "I don't think I need
a hat just now, aunt Mary."</p>

<p>"Do you sell a great deal?" "Yes 'urn, but sometimes 'tis mighty hard
to get money out ter our people. Dat ar &mdash;&mdash; (naming the man) tuck a
dress from me for his wife; can't get a nickel from him, and every time
he see me he dodge inter some corner." "How do they pay? Cash?" "No, one
dollar a week till dey finish payin." "As a general thing I suppose they
try to meet you pretty promptly, don't they?" "Lors, no, honey! dey alus
put me off; but I keep a runin' and runin' every week jis ter make dem
tell lie."</p>

<p>The subject of the hat, etc., rested here, and aunt Mary took up some of
her experience at church. "Broder &mdash;&mdash; (she said, calling the preacher
by name) get so now-a-days he don't preach out ter de Bible no more. He
alus (always) on de path, he aint got time ter look in de book. I aint
got nara larnin, but I kin tell if anybody is preachin out ter de Bible.
We had a meetin ter vote him out de other day and I was a sittin' near
de stove; I hear dat ar &mdash;&mdash; (calling the person's name) say, 'Broder A.,
I don't want you to go 'way, I want you to stay,' and she was a sittin'
right up under de preacher's coat tail; and who tell you she didn't
wisper somethin ter him, then look at me and laugh?" "Is that so?" "Tis
so, honey! and I jis tuck up de shovel and went for her." Aunt Mary was
now on her feet, poker grasped in her hand, and arm lifted above her
head. "Laugh agin, says I, laugh agin, Miss Nigger, and I will stave
you down, who dar you to laugh at me, you unfogotten, hen-pecken,
know-nothin, off-scorn of the eart."</p>

<p>With this, aunt Mary slung her bag across her shoulder, took up her hat
box, bade good morning, and as she got through the gate, struck out at
the very top of her voice one of her favorite melodies.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_FROM_OAHE_SCHOOL_DAKOTA" id="LETTER_FROM_OAHE_SCHOOL_DAKOTA"></a>LETTER FROM OAHE SCHOOL, DAKOTA.</h2>

<h4>BY MISS JULIA E. PRATT.</h4>

<p>A very sad incident came into our life as a school last winter, which
has accentuated anew the ignorance and the superstitious heathenism of
these Indian people.</p>

<p>One of our little boys was sent to the dormitory one morning to do some
work to which he objected, and, while pretending to obey, he took one of
the other little boys with him and ran away. Their absence was not
discovered until it was too late to overtake them, and as their home was
only ten miles away, and we knew they were good walkers, as all Indians
are almost from babyhood, we had every reason to believe they would
reach home in safety. They had started before daylight, and without any
breakfast, and the little boy who was enticed away had no overcoat nor
mittens, but had gone on the impulse of the moment without taking any
extra clothing. About ten o'clock, it grew very cold, and as the little
fellow had on shoes, to which he was unaccustomed, his feet became so
cold and tired that he could not go on. Then the boy who had coaxed him
away gave him his overcoat and mittens and went on, reaching home about
noon, telling that he had run away, and that he had left Jaran about
half way. Jaran's father did not believe the story, and came back to us,
ten miles, to see if it were true. This made us very anxious, but
nothing could be done but to await the issue. It seemed as if a series
of unfortunate mistakes had combined to bring about this result; and to
make everything still more puzzling, Mr. Riggs, our superintendent, was
away. He reached home that evening, and the next morning sent the
steward to learn the fate of the little runaway. He went on until he
found the little boy's cap and mittens, and the place where he had
evidently lain all night. It was a bitter night, and we knew that he
could not possibly have survived, in his exhausted condition, and not
knowing how to protect himself, even if he had had the means for so
doing. This, in itself, was a very bitter experience for us, but the
worst was yet to come. Mr. Riggs found it impossible to get an Indian to
go to the assistance of these poor people. They were all <i>afraid</i>.
Rumors were afloat that the father was going to shoot anyone connected
in any way with the school, Indian or white. When an Indian is
sorrow-stricken over the death of a friend or relative, he alleviates
his suffering by killing some one else.</p>

<p>After the little boy was buried, the family came to the school. The old
grandmother brought the clothes he had on when found&mdash;and which they had
cut off,&mdash;spread them out before Mr. Riggs, and reproached him for
sending a little boy out into a storm so insufficiently clad; to which
Mr. <span class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>[259]</span>Riggs replied that we had no idea he was going out into the storm,
that he was dressed for the house, and had we known he was going on a
journey, he would have been dressed for it. She would not be pacified,
however, and after bitterly reproaching Mr. Riggs for the death of her
grandson, she <i>demanded pay</i> for it, as if money would make up to them
his loss.</p>

<p>That afternoon, at the woman's meeting, we learned that they had given
away everything they possessed, furniture, clothing, bedding, dishes,
and were absolutely destitute of the barest necessities of life. This is
one of their customs. They reason thus: Our child is dead; our hearts
are sad; life has no longer any attractions; take all we have. The
Christian Indian women in our church each gave something out of her
little property to help these poor heathen people, who in their
superstitious ignorance had made their lot so wretched. Taking this,
they returned home and demanded of the family of the other poor boy a
cow in <i>payment</i> for the death of their child.</p>

<p>And there came to me this question: Is it possible that in the midst of
this beautiful free land of ours, there lives a people so densely
ignorant, so darkly superstitious, sunk so low in heathenism, as this
incident shows? And this is only one of many such incidents. May God
help us when such things are possible in a Christian land.</p>

<h4>BY JEE GAM.</h4>

<p>I reached Petaluma a little while before school began. The scholars soon
poured in and the attendance was the largest the school ever had. In
order to have a little preaching service, we hurried through the
lessons. At the conclusion of school, two hymns were sung. I then
preached to them of Jesus. They all listened very attentively and
appeared interested. At the close, I asked them to come again the next
evening and bring their friends. To my great surprise, the next evening
not only all the scholars came, but many outsiders; some of these had
years ago attended our school for some little time, but the majority of
them had never been inside our mission. I was informed, after the
meeting, that five or six of them were very highly educated in Chinese,
and that they were chief officers of the Chinese Branch Masonic Society
in Petaluma. I thought they came simply for curiosity and perhaps for
argument. Just before the meeting commenced, I went into my room, knelt
down and said to God: "Oh Lord, Thou art the Almighty God, Thou knowest
the motives of those who have come to this meeting; Thou knowest I am
very weak. I can do nothing without Thy help, so I beseech Thee to make
me a good agent in Thy hand. Give me the right word to speak, fill me
with power."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>[260]</span>I arose from prayer and felt that God was with me. I went into the
meeting and announced my subject. It was on Daniel being cast into the
lions' den. I noticed the marked interest they all seemed to feel. At
the close, I again asked all present to come the next evening (Sunday
evening) and bring more friends.</p>

<p>The Sabbath evening meeting came. Sunday-school began at six o'clock.
Not only the scholars and every one of the outsiders who had attended
the meeting of the night before came, but many others besides, so that
we had to bring in extra benches, and yet we lacked room.</p>

<p>My subject this evening was Daniel, third chapter, the three Hebrew
children cast into the fiery furnace, being a continuation of my Bible
reading of the previous evening. I endeavored to bring home to my
countrymen three things: 1st.&mdash;That this was the true God, and he was
the Supreme Ruler mentioned by our Confucius, Mencius and other sages.
2d.&mdash;He was all-powerful and not like the golden image which
Nebuchadnezzar had set up, nor like the idols that we Chinese serve.
3d.&mdash;He was able to save all those that put their trust in Him. He is
<i>just as able</i> and as <i>willing</i> to <i>save</i> us <i>to-day</i> as He was when He
saved Daniel and his three countrymen, provided we are willing to trust
in Him, as these men did, for He is the same yesterday, to-day and
forever. The golden image could not protect from the dangers of the fire
the king's mighty men that cast Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego into the
furnace. And why? Because it was simply an image, the work of men's
hands. And now, what are our Chinese idols? Are not they the works of
men's hands too? We all say that they are true gods and are very
powerful; yet, you all well know that we have a common saying: "Though
the gods are powerful, yet they are not able to protect an <i>unfortunate</i>
man." So let us seek, believe and worship the only true God, and Him
alone.</p>

<p>I had to come away the next day, and felt that perhaps I might never
have another chance to speak to them. The opportunity, too, was one of
the best that any preacher could desire, for they all seemed hungering
for more of the truth. Therefore I went on to tell them that the Son of
God whom Nebuchadnezzar saw in the fiery furnace was this same Jesus
that we Christians believe in and preach to-day. At the conclusion, I
urged all to accept Him as their Saviour. I said: "Of course I cannot
tell you all about Jesus in one evening, for nearly every one of the
thirty-nine books of the Old Testament and every one of the twenty-seven
books of the New Testament speak of Jesus,&mdash;his birth, his life, his
teaching. All these you can find out by reading the Chinese translation
of the Bible, and therefore we earnestly invite you all to read it for
yourselves."</p>

<p>"One of our proverbs says: 'Genuine gold never fears the hot furnace
fire.' So the Bible never fears examination. The more you try it, the
truer you will find it to be. You are all acquainted with the ways of
the Tanist priests. They deceive the people and you all know their
doctrines <span class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>[261]</span>and tricks will not bear inspection. For example, the manner
in which they pretend to catch demons; they go to the house with their
gongs, cymbals, etc., and pretend to catch the ghost and place him in a
jar. After they have caught him, they will not <i>allow you</i> to open the
jar to view him. Why? The Bible you see is as true as the broad
daylight, for it has borne the inspection of centuries. The doctrines of
the Tanist priests differ in this respect. Their teaching will not stand
criticism nor examination, while the Bible stands the tests of all
times, and it is fast becoming the standard book of the nations of the
world."</p>

<p>The meeting was then closed with a prayer. I said to them, "I shall be
happy to have any one ask questions about Jesus and I will endeavor to
answer." But no question was asked, so I gave each a tract to take home
to read. After they had left, a Chinese laundryman and two of his
employees came. I learned that they had come before and found the room
so crowded that they could not enter. I had a very pleasant visit from
them. I talked to them both of their spiritual and temporal welfare.</p>

<p>May God bless the seed sown there and grant that all the Petaluma
Chinese may find salvation in Jesus Christ, our Lord.</p>

<h2><a name="DEATH_OF_LEUNG_KEE" id="DEATH_OF_LEUNG_KEE"></a>DEATH OF LEUNG KEE.</h2>

<h4>BY MRS. C.A. SHELDON.</h4>

<p>Leung Kee was but 16 years old and was in a store with his uncle, a
heathen, but a fine-looking man and one whose character is worthy of
respect. He had just joined our Christian Association when he was taken
sick. His uncle thought his sickness came because he had become a
Christian, and he begged of him to go back to his old religion, but he
said "No," he would trust in Jesus. Just as he died, his uncle again
asked him if he should not burn incense, but he still said "No," and
asked the Christian brethren to pray with him. As soon as we heard of
his death, Miss Watson and I called. The uncle was very courteous, told
us that Leung Kee was a Christian boy, and he wanted us to do just what
we thought best. Our pastor, Dr. Hutchins, attended the funeral with us
and made some very touching remarks. We had singing by the Christian
brethren and others who were there. The uncle was attentive, and more
than once tears were in his eyes. At the grave we sang a hymn. Chung Moi
prayed in Chinese; all joined in the Lord's prayer in Chinese, then we
sang again, "O think of the home over there." The uncle came and thanked
us for our kindness to his boy; said it was his brother's son, but just
like his own; I wish all who think the Chinese have no heart could have
heard the tremor in his voice and seen his quivering lips and his eyes
full of tears. One of the Christian brethren told us that he said
afterwards that he would join the Christian Association himself if he
were not so old. So I think perhaps our young brother's early death may
do more for his countrymen than his life would have done. I pray that it
may be so.</p>

<h2><a name="A_VISIT_TO_A_MISSION_SUNDAY-SCHOOL" id="A_VISIT_TO_A_MISSION_SUNDAY-SCHOOL"></a>A VISIT TO A MISSION SUNDAY-SCHOOL.</h2>

<h4>BY MRS. L.S. HITCHCOCK.</h4>

<p>One Lord's day, I went out to look after a Sunday-school in which one of
our missionaries had become interested, and where she labored part of
the year. The day was excessively warm. The distance was two miles, and
the horse cars would only take me half the way, leaving a walk across
the fields for the rest of the trip. There was no road, and much of the
way not even a footpath, and the fields were partly covered with water
from the frequent showers. I got along quite well during the first half
of my walk by picking my way, now and then elongating steps, or jumping,
generally with satisfactory results. Presently a place appeared where
the water seemed too wide to venture with safety. There was no
possibility of jumping this time, and I was ready to give up in despair,
when I discovered at some little distance a log laid across the narrow
part of the stream. I commenced the tight rope walk and was just
congratulating myself upon my heroic adventure which, with one step
more, would have landed me safely on the other side, when the log tilted
and off I went, my knees plowing into the mud making a hole as big as
grandma's workbasket. I lost no time in getting up. As I arose, I saw my
<i>best</i> parasol and big palm-leaf fan floating along leisurely in the
muddy stream. These were secured later, but with much trouble, and my
portmanteau was fished from the hidden deep at the peril of crabs and
other biters who make such places homes of retreat.</p>

<p>I called at the nearest cabin, and found "Auntie" with a kind heart
ready to undertake the job of "cleaning me up." She took in the
situation at once, ejaculating, "Lor', honey! specs Is'e goin ter let
yer go ter Sunday-school wid dem ar close all spilt? Sam, take dem ar
shoes and wash em clar fru for Missus."</p>

<p>In a short time she said, "You's fine," and I started for the little
church close by, arriving just five minutes before the Sunday-school
closed. I was greeted with "Howdy" by the pastor, who is superintendent,
and was requested to speak to the children, while the whole Sunday
school, including twenty-six boys and girls, and seven fathers and
mothers, rose to their feet, indicating their delight to see me.</p>

<p>I was in time to observe one little boy standing on tiptoe to reach up
to the Bible which the minister held open on the table and was teaching
him to read. It was his custom, as he was the only teacher, to call each
one separately, and teach him to read, as well as his ignorance would
allow. This is in advance of their old way of conducting Sunday-school.
Formerly, all the instruction received was from Webster's "blue back,"
and, for the closing exercise, they counted from one to a hundred. The
pastor attended school at Straight University during the past year and
can read a little, but not intelligently. He looks as if he had seen
sixty years or more, and I believe him to be a good man who tries to do
faithful work for the Master so far as he is able. He has built a little
church, mostly with his own hands and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>out of his own scanty earnings. It
is made of rough boards, but it has a good foundation and the roof is
well shingled. There are no glass windows, but boards like a barn door
hung on hinges serve to let in the light or shut out the cold in winter.</p>

<p>The people are ignorant beyond description. Most of them live in little
huts or cabins on the banks of the canal, getting a scanty living by
working out as they can find places.</p>

<p>Their homes are filthy and uninviting. How much good a missionary could
accomplish by going into their homes and teaching them the true
Christian way of living! The mothers with whom I talked seemed willing,
and even anxious, to know better ways. Any instruction in housekeeping
would be gratefully received, and a sewing class, where cutting and
making plain clothing were taught, would be eagerly accepted. A mothers'
meeting once a week would be more helpful to those barren minds than
words can express. The work is right there, all ready and waiting for
some loving, self-denying Christian woman to take up. Who in the far-off
Northland will say, "Lord, here am I, send me," and who will reach deep
in their pockets and say, "I will give a tenth, yea, even more," for
that which is more is the only true giving? May God open the hearts of
those who have an abundance and to spare, to give liberally for the
uplifting of our colored brothers and sisters.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_FRESH_DRINK" id="THE_FRESH_DRINK"></a>THE FRESH DRINK.</h2>

<p>A missionary teacher to the mountain whites, who was laid aside
temporarily from teaching, on account of illness, writes of one of the
children of her charge:</p>

<p>I must tell you of the little native girl who lived with us, and of her
practical application of a Scripture text. It was my custom to teach her
from the Bible every Sabbath afternoon. I had been reading from the
ninth chapter of Mark, where it speaks of the child-like spirit our dear
Saviour wants us to possess.</p>

<p>She listened very attentively, and seemed especially interested when we
came to the forty-first verse, "For whosoever shall give you a cup of
water to drink in my name, ... he shall not lose his reward."</p>

<p>She left me a few moments, but presently came back saying: "Won't you
tell me about that verse again?" I gladly complied; then came the
question, "Does it mean me&mdash;can I do something for Jesus?"</p>

<p>That evening, there came a gentle rap on my door, and to my "Come in,"
Minnie entered, bearing a glass of water.</p>

<p>Coming near, she placed the water on a little stand by my bedside.
Noticing that she stood as though she would speak, I said, "What is it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>Minnie?" She hesitated a moment, then replied: "I was thinking about
what you said about the 'cup of water,' and I wanted to give you
something 'cause you was sick, but I didn't have anything, so I thought
may be you might like a fresh drink of water, for it's all I've got."</p>

<p>Indeed, my heart was touched by this poor girl's beautiful application
of the lesson learned; nor was it forgotten&mdash;every evening during my
illness came the "fresh drink" from the hands of the little beginner,
who wanted to do something for Jesus.</p>

<div class="right">JUNE 5th, 1889.</div>

<p><i>Friends at the East:</i></p>

<p>It is summer over here now and every thing looks green and nice. The
roses are red and beautiful, so every day everybody has a bouquet on his
coat. There are lots of more flowers, some of them are white, blue, red,
yellow; so everything looks nice.</p>

<p>The girls always decorate the church on Sunday. They get lots of flowers
on the hills and down in the bottom. The days have been nice for about
two weeks. The sun shines every day, and the wind has not blown for a
long time, but to-day the wind blows just a little but not much.</p>

<p>We always play ball, and have nice times playing. But some times we get
hurt. The Perkins Hall boys always play ball with the Whitney Hall boys,
but the Whitney boys always get beaten.</p>

<p>Everybody on the Reservation has ploughed his field and planted corn,
potatoes, onions, squashes, beets, turnips, wheat, oats, flax, beans and
melons, so everything is just coming out, and after a while they will
grow big and good to eat.</p>

<p>Mr. Lawson went away in May, and the boys had to work up there alone.
They worked all right, and when he came back he found that all papers
were ready to be printed. He came back with some galley-holders and some
cases. After he had been back about two weeks, another machine came; it
is the paper cutter. It is a nice machine for the printing office. Seven
boys work in the morning and six in the afternoon, so we are getting
along first rate.</p>

<p>We always go after tipsina on the hills; some of the people call them
wild turnips. They are very good to eat. If you don't know them, you
lose something in your life. You don't know how they taste unless you
have eaten some. They have dark-blue flowers on them which stand about
four or five inches from the ground. They are easy to find out, and when
we find them, we have to dig them. When we come back, we always get so
tired that we lay down under the trees.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
